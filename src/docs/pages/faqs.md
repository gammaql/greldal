# Frequently Asked Questions

## Is it possible to build a single GraphQL APIs backend by multiple databases ? 

Yes, GRelDAL makes this very easy. You simply need to specify a Data Source level connector instead of using a shared global connector.

Business logic can remain totally oblivious of which database (or data source) an entity is coming from.

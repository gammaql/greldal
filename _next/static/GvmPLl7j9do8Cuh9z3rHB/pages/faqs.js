We are big fans of [ndb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ndb).\nAlso, GRelDAL internally uses debug package for debug logging. So you can set the DEBUG environment variable to get informative logs on exactly what is going on under the hood.

Can it be supported ?",members:[{content:"We are currently focussing on databases which are supported by [Knex](https://knexjs.org/) - which is our underlying data access layer.

The core of GRelDAL doesn't have database specific features, but in future we may introduce extension modules to simplify integration with database specific features.\nIn case you need to use database vendor specific features right now, it is easily to construct and use raw queries.\n"}]},{title:"Can we use database vendor specific features ?",members:[{content:"Yes.
